## Description
  An Interactive React Dashboard app that queries a GitHub GraphGL API to search for and return topics from Github!  Upon starting, the app displays all "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#topic)" related to the term "react" and displays the top ten related topics with how many 
  "[stargazers](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#stargazerconnection)" each topic has (stargazers are users that have starred a topic). The list of related topics is clickable, and upon clicking each topic the page searches and renders the clicked term with the results related to it.

## Technologies Used  
  This app uses Create-react-app (react), jest, axios, JavaScript, Bootstrap, useState and useEffect hooks, and Github GraphQL API.
