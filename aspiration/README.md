# Aspiration: GitHub Topic Explorer

## Description
  An Interactive React Dashboard app that queries a GitHub GraphQL API to search for and return topics from Github!  The app displays the first ten "[topics](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#topic)" related to the term "react" with how many 
  "[stargazers](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/reference/objects#stargazerconnection)" each topic has. This list of related topics is clickable, and upon clicking, the page searches and renders the clicked term with the results related to it.  The app also has an input field with error handling where a user can search for a term not on the list.
